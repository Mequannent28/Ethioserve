## 🌐 Deploy to Render (One Click!)

1. Click the **Deploy to Render** button above
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **Create Web Service** — that's it! ✅

The app auto-configures everything:
- ✅ MariaDB database (bundled inside)
- ✅ Schema + seed data (auto-imported)
- ✅ Apache web server (auto-configured)
- ✅ PHP 8.2 with all extensions

Your app will be live at: `https://ethioserve.onrender.com` 🎉

> **Note:** On Render's free tier, the service spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. The first request after spin-down takes ~30 seconds to start up, and the database is re-seeded with fresh data.
